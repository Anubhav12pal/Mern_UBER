for mongoose:

schema.methods.function(): this method works for the instances of the model/ sechma and not directly for the model:
for when a user is created using schema.create this is an instance of the model and function can be used here

on the other hand:
schema.static.function:
This can be used by the model itself: model.function()

and not by the instances such as the individual user that we created

Create an app where u require express and create an app then export it
then require that app in server and listen to that server

Check iof it runs fine

Setup the database

require the connection to the db in the app and connect to db

Then focus on creating the user model :

Get schema through mongoose define hash function as static
and auth  and compare passwords as instance methods on the schema , generate teh model and then export the model

Now begin creatingf routes for the user:

make the register route and use express validator body middlewares to check conditions, then instead of a traditional callback u call the controller function


The controller has the logic:

forst check for errors using express validator 
 then get the things form req.body
 then use the model to create user but that is done inside user.service
