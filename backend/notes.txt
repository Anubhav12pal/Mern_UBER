for mongoose:

schema.methods.function(): this method works for the instances of the model/ sechma and not directly for the model:
for when a user is created using schema.create this is an instance of the model and function can be used here

on the other hand:
schema.static.function:
This can be used by the model itself: model.function()

and not by the instances such as the individual user that we created
